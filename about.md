<p>Hi! My name is Henrique Silveira and I am a Computer Engineer. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at Microsoft. My interests include Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am fascinated by science and technology and I am eager to make the world a better place!

<p>I graduated from University of SÃ£o Paulo in 2017. Before graduating, I did an interesting <a href="https://github.com/henrisilver/DeepLearningCancer">research project</a> related to Deep Learning and using gene expression data, in which I compared different Deep Learning architectures used for analyzing that data in the context of cancer diagnosis. I am glad to have been able to work on such a relevant project, which enabled me to explore Machine Learning and also to contribute to an important topic such as cancer. In 2014, I spent the year at Columbia University as a visiting non-degree student. In my free time I enjoy playing video games and and playing sports.</p>
